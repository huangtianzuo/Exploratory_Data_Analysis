## There are two folders in this document: Code_Portfolio and Final_Project. 
### For the Code_Portfolio, I created an R Script for each week, except Week 4 and Week 8 because there is no code for me to collect. 
### I really appreciate this assignment. Not only did I write down the important codes in each chapter with my own notes for future references, but I also read through the whole textbooks to learn more about EDA.
